You are being trained to be an adventurer in the kingdoms captital.
Along side you, your best freind Loka is training to be a mage.
On a quite Saturaday afternoon you head over to Loka's to ask for magical assitance.
Loka: "I Don't Think Thats Possible"
You: "Why Not, Your the Best Divination Mage in your Class..
      Surely You can use a Scying Spell to let me see my Family,
      Its Been Ages.
Loka: "Its Not a matter of If I Want to, Its If I Can, Thats A Spell Two Levls Above Me..
    *Sigh*.....I guess Ill Give It A Shot

Loka Unveils a mirror, Sits Down in Front Of It And Begins TO Focus...
Soon a View Of Your Village from Above Comes into Focus...
Something Does Not Look Right..........
You See Smoke Billowing Out From The Houses, Bodies In The Street,
Villagers Doing Their Best To Fight Off A Hord Of Gnolls To Little Avail.
You and Loka Turn To Look At Each Other In Horror.

You: I Must Go!
Loka: Wait! Lets Get Some Help!
You: There's No Timne!
Loka:Fine I'm Coming With!

You Grab Is Your Sword, Loka Grabs Is Her Staff and You Both Sprint Out Into The Street,
then down the Road To Your VIllage.
